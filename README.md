# NetworkPerformance
## Special Topics: Spatial and Interactive Audio | EMAR 391 | Spring 2021 

### Course Descrition 

This digital production course will explore the technical and conceptual fundamentals of computation and interactivity in the context of music-making and sound/interactive design. 
The first part of this course will allow students to map and explore code, interfaces, and sound design. 
The goal is to apply these skills to create an interactive sound system in node based programming environment. 
They will also be required to peer review one anotherâ€™s work. During the second part of the semester, students will use the JavaScript-based programming language P5.js and its libraries. Some of these libraries include P5.sound for sound; ML5js for computer vision and machine learning. 
In the third part of the course, using these languages, students will take on a creative, interdisciplinary approach to network performance and production practice. At the end of the course, a network-based final project will be used to evaluate these skills.


About Project
-------------------
Given the limitations of performance art during this pandemic, how can we offer a virtual space that enables people to develop their own medium through a web environment? So we created a network performance, which is similar to an online game experience. After the software is downloaded, performers can communicate through a server and exchange data to control synthesizers and produce new sounds. Thus our work allows us to collaborate and creatively experiment with new interactive sounds through this network environment.
