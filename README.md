 networkPerformance
=======

This digital production course will explore the technical and conceptual fundamentals of computation and interactivity in the context of music-making and sound/interactive design. 
The first part of this course will allow students to map and explore code, interfaces, and sound design. 
The goal is to apply these skills to create an interactive sound system in node based programming environment. 
They will also be required to peer review one anotherâ€™s work. During the second part of the semester, students will use the JavaScript-based programming language P5.js and its libraries. Some of these libraries include P5.sound for sound; ML5js for computer vision and machine learning. 
In the third part of the course, using these languages, students will take on a creative, interdisciplinary approach to network performance and production practice. At the end of the course, a network-based final project will be used to evaluate these skills.




Testtest

*Test* testtest.

### networkPerformance

A *Test* is a simplified variant of a mesh asset that only has
vertices and skin weights. When converted from an original mesh, all the
topological data of triangles is removed and overlapped vertices are
stripped out.
